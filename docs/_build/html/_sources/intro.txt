Introduction
==============

ctelib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
cte XML schema.

With ctelib (ctelib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the cte XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the cte schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in ctelib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the cte XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent cte types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The ctelib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The ctelib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
